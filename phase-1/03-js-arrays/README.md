# JavaScript Arrays

- Create and manipulate arrays in JavaScript using array indexing
- Use for loops to access and manipulate data in arrays
- Use .map(), .find(), .filter(), and .forEach() to access and manipulate data in arrays


### Warm up 

In your own words, what is an array and why is it useful in programming?


arrays can be useful in programming because they can store many types of data in a way that allows for easy retrieval and reference as you continue writing code

indexed storage e.g. stores objects/values.

Array = a type of data structure( a special type of object) which can associate and organize  a collective data

An array is type of object that lists items in a particular order.

An array is a list-like object that contains a collection of elements stored in one location

An array is a way to store multiple pieces of data inside of just one variable, it allows cleaner code and better readability by storing all of the items into one specific place that can be referred to later.

- object 
- list like 
- ordered lists
- indexed starting 0
- items, technical terms: elements 
- can save multiple values in one array
- can return different data types as elements
