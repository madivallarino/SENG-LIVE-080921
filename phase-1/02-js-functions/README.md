# JavaScript Functions

### Goals:
- Explain why functions are important in JS
- Understand the difference between declaring and invoking a function
- Understand what a first-class function is and why that matters in JS
- Create and use callback functions
- Understand function scope vs global scope


### Warm up question:

What are functions and why do we use them?

- building blocks of javascript 
- expressions/ statements receive input and do something in the code block and return something 
- dynamic and flexible, can accept diff arguments to run same code. reuse that logic 
- control the flow of the program
- multiple statements, keep a function within its own scope. local scopes 
- separation of responsibilites
